### Azusaing's new blog is available~

- As I am really dissatisfied with the design of my last blog, I've decided to migrate my blog to a new framework: **hexo**, this platform has bunch of 'fine arts' so I wouldn't have to design one on my own, then be tortured by my poor artisitic talent.
- I will continue my work for more features on this new website based on the previous backend, including but not limited to 'Comments', 'Resource Sharing' and a more aesthetically pleasing interface. 
- new address -> https://azusaing.top
